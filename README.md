## What is V3? <a name = "about"></a>
We started with Support early in the year 2017.
So mutsch has changed. There is a new SinusBot v8 engine. 
And of course our experience  ans skills has also increased over time.


V3 finally runs on TypeScript. Yes, we love TypeScript.
We already experimented with typescript and webpack in the year 2018.

Now we feel ready to renew the most popular support script for TeamSpeakÂ³.

- We will also have our own plugin / script loading system. This way we can introduce our own plugins for Support ++. 

- And then finally there is a web interface. 

- Is there a German config? -
*we will now also answer this nervous question* **YES!! in any language you want.**

- Support ++ will finally support Discord. From now on we will always work in parallel. We say "Hello to Discord!"
